            <h3><strong>A Moving Introspective</strong></h3>
            <hr width="100" size="10" noshade>
            <p>In this intimate and resonant account of his seven years in the White House, James Margherio takes the reader inside the Oval Office, the Situation Room, and the restroom during the most pivotal moments of his presidency. From Missy Elliot's selection as Vice President to his decision, one year before the end of his second term, that he was &quotdone with this sh*t&quot, Margherio explains in thoughtful detail the personal and professional considerations that shaped his choices. He offers a wry yet honest account of his own goals, met and unmet, and a withering take on the body odor of his detractors and political adversaries.</p>
